# MDX for Sublime

[MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) syntax highlighting support for `.mdx` files in Sublime Text 3.

### Notes
- It works but isn’t perfect. I have no idea what I’m doing; and I could use and would appreciate help improving it.
- `mdx.sublime-syntax` was adapted from [babel-sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime).
