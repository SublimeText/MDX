### Manual Install

1. Download appropriate [MDX.sublime-package](https://github.com/SublimeText/MDX/releases) for your Sublime Text build.  
   _A suffix (e.g. `-st4xxx`) denotes the least required ST build for the sublime-package to work._
2. Rename it to _MDX.sublime-package_
3. Copy it into _Installed Packages_ directory

> **Note**

>
> 1. call _Menu > Preferences > Browse Packages.._
> 2. Navigate to parent folder

> Manually installed packages are not automatically updated by Package Control.

## Usage

1. Open an `.mdx` file
2. Select `View > Syntax > MDX`

## Troubleshooting

MDX extends Sublime Text's HTML and Markdown syntax definitions.

If MDX syntax highlighting doesn't work and console displays syntax errors in _MDX.sublime-syntax, please make sure to remove any out-dated syntax override.

Steps:

1. call _Menu > Preferences > Browse Packages.._
2. Look for _HTML_, _Markdown_ and _JavaScript_ folders
3. Remove them or at least delete any syntax definition in them.
